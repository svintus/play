h1. PATCH NOTES

This Play 1.3 patch adds a fix for multiple database support. In order to separate entities between DBs, each model class needs to be annotated with some specific persistence annotation pointing to the DB name that it's meant to belong to. JPA adds all @Entity annotated models to the Default database but not to the slave DB - this patch makes it add all @Entity annotated models to all databases. To separate data in the future, add the DB name check back in and use the proper persistence tag.
